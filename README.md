From the Line Chart of the Outcomes Based on Goals for Plays Subcategory above, we could draw the following conclusions:
1. The percentage successful decreases as the goal value increases.
2. The percentage failed increases as the goal value increases.
3. The percentage canceled increases as the goal value decreases, but is lower than the percentage failed and successful, indicating in general the cancellation rate is relatively low.
4. Between 30000 and 44999, A locally spike of the percentage successful indicates a small increase despite of the general trends of success decrease as the goal value increases; A locally trough of the percentage failed indicates a small decrease despite of the general trends of failure increase as the goal value increases.
