From the Line Chart of the Outcomes Based on Goals for Plays Subcategory above, we could draw the following conclusions:
1. The percentage successful decreases as the goal value increases.

4. Between 30000 and 44999, A locally spike of the percentage successful indicates a small increase despite of the general trends of success decrease as the goal value increases; A locally trough of the percentage failed indicates a small decrease despite of the general trends of failure increase as the goal value increases.

2. In February, small spike occur for both successful and failed campaigns, indicating possible increase in successful kickstarter.
3. In October, a local increase in failed campaigns exceeds the increase of successful ones, which could result from zero canceled campaigns.
